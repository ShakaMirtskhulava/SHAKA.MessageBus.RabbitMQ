SHAKA.MessageBus.RabbitMQ is an implementation of the MessageBus abstraction built specifically for RabbitMQ in .NET applications. It enables robust, reliable, and scalable messaging between components or microservices, taking full advantage of RabbitMQâ€™s powerful features.

This package provides a simple API for message publishing and subscribing, while abstracting away the complexities of directly working with RabbitMQ.

Features
RabbitMQ-based messaging: Seamlessly integrates RabbitMQ for high-performance, reliable message delivery.
MessageBus abstraction: Works with any system that implements the MessageBus pattern, allowing decoupled communication across services.
Async/Synchronous Messaging: Easily support both synchronous and asynchronous messaging patterns.
High Scalability: Handle high-throughput message flows across distributed systems without compromising on performance.
Simple Integration: Easy to set up and integrate into existing projects.
